# Phonegap-FileTransfer-test
a simple test of Phonegaps's FileTransfer API

**Abstract:** The FileTransfer object provides a way to upload files using an HTTP multi-part POST request, and to download files as well.

**NOTE:** This is poorly doucmented. It is required to have the [File plugin](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file) installed along with FileTransfer!
